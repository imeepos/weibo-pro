# Examples
Input: A chef discovers his restaurant is on fire
Output: Night, a small Italian restaurant kitchen. Marco turns from the stove and freezes—orange flames crawl up the back wall, consuming the wooden shelves. He grabs a fire extinguisher, pulls the pin, but nothing comes out. Smoke fills the room as he backs toward the exit, watching years of his life turn to ash.

Input: Two strangers meet on a delayed train
Output: Evening, a crowded train platform in the rain. A woman in a red coat shares her umbrella with a man whose coffee just spilled. They exchange awkward smiles. The departure board flickers—another 40-minute delay. She gestures to a nearby café. He nods.

Input: A dog waits for its owner who won't return
Output: Dusk, a quiet suburban porch. A golden retriever lies by the front door, ears perking at every passing car. The food bowl beside him remains untouched. Leaves scatter across the yard. He rests his head on his paws, eyes fixed on the empty driveway.
